A: That wasn't very nice of her.
B: She said that nothing is more important to me than money.
A: What did you say? --what
B: I told her I wouldn't trade her for any other woman in the world.

A: Some people have good noses.
B: I wish I had a good nose. Mine is way too big.
A: I don't mean good-looking. I mean good-smelling.
B: Oh. But that can be a curse.
A: Yes, because you can be too sensitive to odors.
B: I'll say. My girlfriend has a nose like a drug dog.
A: Did she catch you using drugs? --yn
B: Sort of. She knows whenever I sneak a cigarette.
A: You don't need a good nose for that—cigarettes stink.
B: But when I sneak just one cigarette in the morning, she can smell it that evening!
A: Boy, that is a good nose.
B: I told her she should apply for a job at customs.

A: Let's go out to eat.
B: That sounds like fun.
A: Where do you want to go? --where
B: Let me think a minute.
A: I feel like Chinese.
B: That sounds delicious.
A: I know a good Chinese restaurant.
B: How far away is it? --how_far
A: It's only 10 minutes from here.
B: Do we need reservations? --yn
A: Oh, no. We can walk right in.
B: Let's go now. I'm hungry!

A: I can't believe how long this line is.
B: This is a popular restaurant, isn't it? --yn
A: Yes, but it isn't a fast-food restaurant, is it? --yn
B: It's the slowest hamburger in town.
A: That's because they cook it while you wait.
B: Yes. That's why it's also the best hamburger in town.
A: A great burger and great service.
B: Yes, the workers are very polite.
A: And they're clean.
B: I've been coming here for years.
A: Me too.
B: Excuse me. They just called my number.

A: Lunch was delicious.
B: Thank you.
A: What kind of soup was that? --what
B: It was tomato soup.
A: That tasted so good.
B: I put lemon and butter in it.
A: The sandwich was good, too.
B: Everyone likes bacon and tomato sandwiches.
A: Especially on toast.
B: And the pickles were great, too.
A: Tomorrow we'll have rice and fish for lunch.
B: I can't wait.

A: I'm calling the waiter.
B: What's the matter? --what
A: This steak has too much fat.
B: What do you want the waiter to do? --what
A: Bring me a better steak.
B: I wouldn't do that.
A: Why not? --why
B: They will drop the new steak on the floor, step on it, and then spit on it.
A: You're crazy.
B: Then the waiter will give you a big smile as he brings you the new steak.
A: Where do you get these crazy ideas? --where
B: I used to cook in a restaurant!
<end=dialog>
<start=dialog>
A: Let's leave.
B: But we just got here.
A: Did you see the waiter's hands? --yn
B: No.
A: He had dirty fingernails.
B: Really? --yn
A: His nails were black!
B: That's disgusting.
A: And he poured water into our glasses.
B: Yuck! No water for me.
A: I wonder if the cooks' nails are dirty, too.
B: Who cares? --who Let's get out of here.

A: This hot bread is delicious.
B: I like this restaurant because they give you free bread.
A: Well, I think we are paying for it.
B: No. Look at the bill when we get it. There's no charge for the bread.
A: It is delicious, especially with butter.
B: I think we should just leave after we fill up on the bread.
A: They probably wouldn't like that.
B: I'm eating so much bread that I'm getting full.
A: Then stop eating the bread!
B: Okay, just one more piece. Pass the butter, please.
A: If I owned a restaurant, I would never serve hot bread before the main course.
B: That's terrible. I would never go to your restaurant.
<end=dialog>
<start=dialog>
A: Is this a clean restaurant? --yn
B: Well, the tables and chairs look okay.
A: Okay, let's sit down.
B: Check out the silverware.
A: It passes inspection.
B: Here comes the waiter. See if his hands and nails are clean.
A: Well, the waiter looked clean, so I guess it's okay to eat here.
B: You're forgetting about the bathroom.
A: I'm going to just hope that the bathroom is clean.
B: You're not going to examine it before we order dinner? --yn
A: No, I'd rather not find out that it's dirty, because I'm pretty hungry right now.
B: Me, too. Let's forget about germs and focus on food.
<end=dialog>
<start=dialog>
A: Have you seen our waiter? --yn
B: Here he comes now.
A: We've been sitting here for almost 10 minutes.
B: Oops, I guess I was wrong. That isn't our waiter.
A: We can give him five more minutes, and then leave.
B: I'll go up front and talk to the manager.
A: That's a good idea.
B: Maybe they'll give us free drinks for waiting so long.
A: Maybe he'll send us our waiter immediately.
B: Every time we eat out, it's an adventure.
A: Last time, we got seats next to the kitchen.
B: We'll never go there again.

A: Is this table okay? --yn
B: No, it's too close to the kitchen door.
A: How about this table? --how_about
B: No, it's too close to the front door.
A: This looks like a nice table.
B: No, it's too close to the salad bar.
A: Okay, I give up.
B: Well, there is one good table.
A: Great. Which one? --which
B: That one. A group of eight just sat down at it.

A: I don't believe the art world.
B: What is it this time? --what
A: An Andy Warhol drawing.
B: He's a famous artist.
A: He drew two butterflies and a flower on a napkin in a restaurant.
B: Did he sign it? --yn
A: Yes.
B: Is it beautiful? --yn
A: It's just black ink on a white napkin. And the napkin has food stains!
B: So it's not worth much? --yn
A: Only about $30,000.
B: Without the food stains, it would probably be worth more.
