B: The handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless you have a handicapped permit. Will you mostly be parking during the day or night? --yn
A: I park in the daytime.
B: Make sure you pay special attention to the street signs with time limits. Have you noticed those signs? --yn
A: No, I have not seen the signs.
B: Pay attention to what the signs tell you in terms of time limits and what days you can park there. Do you know what the curb colors mean? --yn
A: No, I don't know what the curb colors mean.

B: First of all, did you park somewhere too long or in the wrong spot? --yn
A: I was there too long.
B: Was the area clearly labeled with the time limit and all? --yn
A: Yeah, I saw it.
B: You will need to convince the judge that you couldn't see the signs.
A: Yeah, I understand.
B: Whatever you do, you need to be respectful and polite to the judge.

B: Could you tell where you were supposed to park and for how long? --where,how_long
A: I could tell what I was supposed to do.
B: That's too bad. That means that you can't use receipts or a witness to help you out.
A: I guess not.
B: Try brown-nosing the judge, but don't be too obvious about it.
A: Sure, if it will help.
B: Try and convince him that something was labeled wrong or something.
A: Sounds good!
B: Give it your best shot; it might work.
<end=dialog>
<start=dialog>
A: I don't know how to fight a parking ticket.
B: Did you get written up for exceeding the time limit or for parking where you weren't supposed to be? --where
A: Both.
B: Did you see all the signs and just decide to blow them off? --yn
A: I was confused.
B: Maybe you could explain that you are new and got confused, could you do that? --yn
A: If it might work, I'll go for it!
B: Let the judge see that you are only a poor starving student who won't do it again.
A: I can see how that might work.
B: Without actually saying that the parking ticket guy was an idiot, make it seem as though it was HIS mistake, not yours!
A: I could do that!
B: Try it. It just might save you the price of a parking ticket.

A: I just received a job transfer and need to relocate right away.
B: How long have you been in your current home? --how_long

B: Have you owned your home for a long time? --yn

<topic=Setting an Asking Price>
<start=dialog>
A: How much do you think that I should ask for my house? --how_much
B: Well, there are a lot of factors involved in setting an asking price.
A: What do you look at when setting an asking price? --what
B: We need to look at the selling prices for similar homes in the area. These will vary according to the condition of the home, specific location, and lot size.
A: Do I have to use the comparisons as the asking price for my house? --yn
B: No, but a seller is not going to be able to get a loan if the selling price is a lot higher that what an appraiser feels the home is worth.
A: Isn't it better to price my house really high and see what I can get? --yn
B: You shouldn't set the price of the house unrealistically high. Oftentimes buyers are put off by this practice.
A: Can I change my mind and lower my price if the home doesn't sell? --yn
B: Sure, you can always lower your asking price.
<end=dialog>
<start=dialog>
A: I am not sure what the asking price for my house should be.
B: We have to take in a number of factors in setting an asking price.
A: What do we need to consider in establishing an acceptable price for a home? --what
B: The comparisons to other similar homes in your area give us a good indication of what your home is worth.
A: Is the price that we get by looking at comparisons necessarily the asking price that I have to use for my home? --yn
B: You don't have to use that particular asking price, but the buyer is going to have trouble getting a loan if the house is priced too high.
A: Should I just shoot for the moon and, if I have to lower the price, do it later? --yn
B: You should be realistic in your pricing. Otherwise, many potential buyers just walk away.
A: Can we lower the asking price later if we need to? --yn
B: We can always re-evaluate the asking price in a few weeks, if we aren't getting any offers.
<end=dialog>
<start=dialog>
A: What do you think the asking price of my home should be? --what
B: There are many things to take into consideration when pricing a home.
A: What is involved in figuring out an asking price? --what
B: We need to combine many factors regarding your home to come up with an accurate value for your home.
A: When you look at comparisons, do I necessarily have to ask that price? --when
B: You don't have to use the price from the comparisons as your asking price. However, you must be realistic in what you ask.
A: I think that I am going to set the price really high so that I have room to bargain with the buyers.
B: Don't go overboard in trying to get top dollar. More often than not, that strategy backfires.
A: Is it okay to lower the asking price if the first price isn't bringing in any offers? --yn
B: If the market doesn't support your asking price, we can always re-evaluate our pricing and adjust it.

B: Sellers frequently make a counteroffer. Would you like to counteroffer two hundred ninety thousand dollars? --yn
A: I think that a counteroffer would be wise at this point.
B: I will contact their agent right away with your counteroffer.
A: What should we do if they don't like the counteroffer? --what
B: If the seller doesn't want to accept your counteroffer, they can reject it or come up with a counteroffer of their own.

B: Yes, the buyers called me just an hour ago.
A: Did they accept the counteroffer? --yn
B: They came back with their own counteroffer of five thousand less than you wanted.
A: What do you think about their offer? --what
B: I think that this is a good offer. They also would like to have a 90-day escrow to allow them to sell their home.
A: The length of the escrow is not a huge issue with us.
B: They also want the sale contingent on a good building inspection.
A: That is reasonable, and I accept those conditions.
B: I will let them know that you have accepted their counteroffer. They will be very pleased!

A: I had a message on my phone that the buyers had responded to our counteroffer.

A: Was the counteroffer acceptable to them? --yn

A: Do you feel that their counteroffer is reasonable? --yn
B: Their offer is a good one. They also want to have a short escrow as they have already sold their home and are ready to move in.
A: We can accommodate the buyer's desire for an escrow length of their choosing.
B: They want their building inspector to approve the quality of the house.
A: I would expect that to be the case and accept their counteroffer.
B: I will contact the buyers immediately and let them know of your acceptance of their counteroffer. I am sure they will be excited!

B: They almost accepted your counteroffer price but want to go a little lower. They are offering five thousand less than your counteroffer.
A: In your professional opinion, is this a good offer? --yn
B: Personally in today's market, I would accept the offer. They also want a short escrow as they feel that interest rates are low right now.
A: We can either lengthen or shorten the escrow for the buyer.
B: They want to make sure that the inspector says that there are no major problems with the house before this is a solid deal.
A: Of course, the house will have to pass a basic inspection, but we accept their counteroffer.
B: The buyers will be happy to hear that you have accepted their counteroffer.

A: Is the counteroffer close to the asking price? --yn
B: The counteroffer is for ten thousand less than your asking price.
A: I didn't really want to go that low in my pricing.
B: I agree that that price is too low. Your home is in good shape, and you should get a better price for it.
A: What should I do at this point? --what
B: Since you don't want to go any lower, we can notify them that you are rejecting their latest offer.

A: I am not really ready to accept that low of a price.
B: I wouldn't accept that price either. Your home is in a good area and should command a higher price.
A: Where do we go from here? --where
B: We should notify them that you are rejecting their current offer. They might choose to offer a higher price.

A: Were the offers for a good price? --yn
B: One offer was for the full asking price, one slightly below, and one above.
A: Well, I am going to accept the highest bid, of course!
B: Actually there are a few things to consider other than who is offering the most money.
A: What other factors do I need to consider? --what
B: We need to consider the likelihood of the buyers actually being able to purchase the house.
A: How do we check on the buyer's ability to purchase our home? --how_to
B: We will check to see if these buyers are pre-qualified for the loan amount that they need. This information will help you make a good decision.
A: When we get all of that information, then I will make my decision.
B: When you make that decision, I will present it to the buyers.

A: Did the potential buyers offer a good price? --yn

A: The highest bid is always the best bid!
B: We need to look at the big picture in deciding which bid to accept.
A: What things would you like me to look at? --what
B: Just because a buyer offers the money doesn't mean that they actually have the credit to purchase the home.
A: How do I get the information about a buyer's ability to afford to buy a home? --how_to
B: We will check to see if any of these buyers have a large down payment. A large amount of available cash would be a good sign.
A: I will wait for that information and give you my answer.
B: Please let me know when you have made your decision, and I will contact the buyers.

A: Let's go with the highest bid!
B: We need to look at a number of factors in deciding which bid to go with.
A: What matters besides getting the money for the house? --what
B: We need to make sure that these potential buyers all actually qualify to even purchase a home.
A: I don't even know where to begin checking on a buyer's credit information.
B: We can check to see if these buyers have already sold their current home. This would make them more desirable.

B: The decision to carry part of a loan might be advantageous to you or problematic.
A: Why would I ever want to carry a note on a house? --why

A: Why is my buyer requesting that I carry part of his loan? --why
B: Oftentimes buyers are well able to afford the home but unable to qualify for a loan.
A: Are there any risks in carrying a second mortgage? --yn

B: That is entirely up to you and the buyer.

A: If the purchaser of your home wants you to carry part of the loan, is that good? --yn

B: For investors who can afford to have their money tied up, it can offer a fairly nice return.
A: What advantage is my buyer looking for in having me carry him on paper? --what
B: We are seeing more and more buyers who are not able to qualify for a loan and are able to take out a second mortgage with the owner.
A: Can I lose my money if I carry a second mortgage? --yn
B: It is an investment and carries some risks. You are counting on the housing market to not go into a tailspin.
A: Is there a certain amount of time that I will be carrying this loan? --yn

<start=dialog>
A: Do you have any helpful hints for preparing to move out of my home? --yn
B: The first thing I would do is to make a list of what needs to be done. Then number the items as to what can be done ahead of time.
A: What kinds of things should be on my list? --what
B: First would probably be to get rid of any extra things that you have by having a garage sale.
A: That is a good idea because I have way too much junk.
B: You also should schedule your moving van in advance.
A: Can I begin packing things ahead of time? --yn

A: That would certainly cut down on the price of moving.
B: Make sure that you take the time to schedule your moving van.
A: Would it be okay to get a head start on my packing? --yn
B: Begin by packing things that you don't frequently need. Save only a few things until right before your moving date.
A: When should I have my utilities shut off? --when
B: It is best for you and the new owners to coordinate the transfer of the utilities and what needs to be turned off and on.
<end=dialog>
<start=dialog>
A: I want our moving day to go smoothly and am open to your suggestions.
B: I would suggest that you make a list and check off the items as you go along. The list will get shorter as your moving date approaches.
A: What things do people usually put on their moving-out list? --what
B: One thing that can be done ahead of time is to get rid of excess stuff by having a garage sale.
A: That would mean a lot less time wasted in packing up our things.
B: List scheduling your moving van as an item on your to do list.
A: Do people ever start packing a month or so before moving? --yn
B: You can certainly start packing things that you won't be using right away.
A: I don't know if I should have my utilities shut off or leave them on for the people who are moving in.
B: You could simply have all the utilities shut off on the day you move out, but you might want to coordinate that with the new owners.
